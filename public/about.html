  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm currently learning full-stack web development. I'm a mother, a caregiver, and work 44+ hours away from home. I'm seeking a career change. 
    My goal is to be able to do all, or at least most, of my work at home. Home is also where I am a caregiver for a Veteran who is fighting cancer.
  </p>

  <p>I understand that my portfolio isn't all that great at the moment... It's because I'm still in the learning process. Thus far I've learned 
    HTML and will be learning CSS next. If you come across this portfolio in its early stages please keep your eye out for updates as I learn more.

  <p>
    After I learn CSS I'll be learning Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, SQL and more. I will be able to build a website from the ground up with 
    amazing results!
  </p>

  <p>I've always wanted to get into coding. I've been fascinated with computers and tech ever since I can remember. I wish I had started this 
    journey far before now. I can't change the past, but I can change my future. &#128513
