    <h1>Best Movies According to Nicole</h1>

    <h2>My Favorite 4 Movies/Movie Series</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Avatar</h3>

    <p>
        I love everything from the storyline to the artwork! An amazing story brought to life in one of the most creative worlds I've ever seen. 
        If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can't recommend it enough! (Note: I'm refering to the movie with the blue people, not the air bender one.)

    <h3>Memoirs of a Geisha</h3>

    <p>
        I loved seeing the world through a Geisha's eyes. The main character grows up to became a Geisha right before the war. 
        I loved how the main character overcame all odds over and over again and was finally able to be with her true love.

    <h3>The Hobit and Lord of the Rings series</h3>

    <p>
        Medieval fantasy is one of my favorite genres. J.R. Tolkien did such an absolutely AMAZING job creating entire languages 
        and an entire world to breathe life into his stories.

    <h3>Serenity</h3>

    <p>
        I highly recommend watching the Sci-Fi series "Firefly" before watching the movie. This movie wraps up the story of Firefly 
        in an amazing Sci-Fi space cowboy story. It was a series cut far too short but the movie did it some justice.
